Exporting from NVivo  
After spending several hours working on your project in NVivo, it’s a good idea to back up your file to 
non-NVivo file formats. These can be useful for sharing portions of the project with team members or 
progress reports to faculty advisers. It’s also an easily accessible record if you are unsure of future access 
to NVivo. Below is a list of elements of a project you may want to export. You can find export options in 
one of two ways:  
1. Open the External Data ribbon to locate the “export” button
 
2. Select the item(s) in the list view. Right click and select export  
 
Nodes 
You have two basic options for downloading nodes. “List” is a list of all nodes but without content. 
“Content” is the content of one node and can only be exported one node at a time.  
? List of your nodes: 
o Open the Node drawer. In List view of Nodes, click on a node. Right click or use 
“external data” ribbon. 
o Export list will prompt you to save a file formatted as .xls 
? Content of one node 
o Open the Node drawer. In List view of nodes, click on a node. Right click or use “external 
data” ribbon. 
o Select Export Node 
? Export Entire content: As HTML file 
? Export Reference view: As Word doc
